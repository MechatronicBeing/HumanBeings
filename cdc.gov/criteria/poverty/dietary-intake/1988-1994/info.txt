Poverty status was defined using the poverty income ratio (PIR) and categorized as :
- below poverty level (poverty income ratio less than 1.30)
- at or above poverty level (poverty income ratio of 1.30 or more).
Poverty income ratio is a calculated variable based on income and family size using tables published each year by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (31). 
This variable has been adjusted to account for inflation and other factors. 
However, the manner in which it is calculated has changed slightly over time. 
The cutoff point selected is consistent with that used to determine eligibility for the Food Stamp Program.
